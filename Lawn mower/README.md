# Roller

## Roller problem

The roller fell off when mowing, due to being worn and the roller cracked at one side. Initially I fixed it with some duct tape, but that only lasted a couple of weeks.


## Roller solution
I designed and 3D-printed a small cylinder, taking the measurements from the roller. The 3D-print was made with high degree if in-fill to make it sturdy.
I placed the cylinder on the tap of the roller and have since then used it weekly for 3 years without further problems.
